# My Vue Router Architecture Approach

This repository should demonstrate my basic approach on Vue Router Architecture and nested routes. It also displays the possibility of handling dialogs with Vue Router

I use a view called `EmptyRouterView` (which just contains a router view, and one for the dialog) to achieve a clean way to structure my nested routing configuration and an easy way to handle dialogs.
