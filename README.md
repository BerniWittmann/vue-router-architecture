# My Vue Router Architecture Approach

This repository should demonstrate my basic approach on Vue Router Architecture and nested routes.

I use a view called `EmptyRouterView` (which just contains a router view) to achieve a clean way to structure my nested routing configuration.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
